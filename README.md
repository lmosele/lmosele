I'm a UX Engineer with a focus on Design Systems & UI Development while specializing in React/Typescript. I'm also really into creating in general! I'm a [photographer](https://www.instagram.com/lukewanders_), occasional [writer](https://medium.com/@l_mosele), and [sort of illustrator](https://www.behance.net/lmosele).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a flexible design system management tool for developers called Açai
- 🔧 During the day I help build out NFT appraisals at [Upshot](https://upshot.io/)
- 👨🏼‍🏫 Twice a week I teach UX for Springboard's UX Course!
